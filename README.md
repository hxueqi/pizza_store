## About The Project

![Screen Shot](client/public/Pizza_recipe.png)

This application allows users to manage a catalog of pizzas and their corresponding ingredients. Users can add and remove ingredients from existing pizzas and specify their order of appearance.

Here's why:

- You can check what pizza you have in the catalog including name, price, and ingredients.
- You can modify your pizza recipe.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
